The inverted arch that forms the works lower portion is composed of massive granite stones that have been repurposed from the curbstones of old roads, and then placed over an invisible inner steel structure.

The universal image is borrowed from a preindustrial era when time could be deciphered by the power of the sun. The arch shape seems to be floating in the reflecting pool and suggests transience, while the tower of steel and stone suggests a reach to the sky. As a form, the work suggests horizontal and vertical architectural elements. Hence, while the image reads as weight with an emphasis on the ground, it also suggests a search for infinite height with the spiraling band of stone traveling up the vertical steel tower. The inverted arch that forms the works lower portion is composed of massive granite stones that have been repurposed from the curbstones of old roads, and then placed over an invisible inner steel structure.
